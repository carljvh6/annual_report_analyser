Companies are doing this by implementing circular economy initiatives, which aim to keep resources in use for as long as possible through recycling and reusing. This shift in mindset requires a comprehensive understanding of the entire supply chain and identifying areas where waste can be minimised.",

These challenges include reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, which make it difficult for farmers to produce food sustainably. The sustainable agriculture solutions help farmers to improve their farming practices, such as water conservation and storage, improved soil health, advanced irrigation techniques, and shade-netting to minimise evaporation. The solutions are offered either directly or via financing cooperatives."
